          If navigating your kitchen feels like going through a scavenger hunt,
          it's probably time to get organized. A cluttered, unorganized kitchen
          can lead to a lot of frustration and make it harder to find motivation
          to cook. Figuring out the right organizational system for your space
          and needs can take some time (and patience), but when you're done,
          spending time in your kitchen will be far more enjoyable. Of course,
          most of us do much more than just food preparation in our kitchens and
          every layout and family style is different. However, there are some
          tried-and-true rules that can apply to any space. So, we asked three
          organizing experts for their best advice on how to organize a kitchen
          in the most functional and tidy way possible.

          "Sort into piles of what we call 'likes with likes,'" Hord says. "For
          example, all appliances together, all bakeware together, all to-go
          cups together, etc. You might not realize how many storage containers
          you've had add up over time. This will help make your decisions easier
          as you can compare items and keep only the best of the best." As far
          as the determining what should be tossed or donated, Murphy suggests,
          "A good rule of thumb in the kitchen is to say goodbye to any
          unnecessary duplicates you’re holding onto as well as anything broken
          or missing parts." Take a long, hard look at small
          appliances—especially those specialty items, like a bread maker, ice
          cream churn, or waffle maker. When was the last time you used them?
          Unless you use an appliance frequently, the space they take up may be
          more valuable for something else.

          Place Items Strategically. "Start by placing everyday dishes and
          glasses near your dishwasher for easy unloading," Marissa Hagmeyer,
          co-founder of Neat Method recommends. "Next, create zones, such as a
          coffee station, based on your daily routines. This might mean placing
          coffee beans, filters, and mugs close to your coffee maker. From
          there, place items next to the area where they're used, such as dish
          towels next to the sink and pots and pans next to the stove. Lastly,
          ensure those top drawers and arms-reach shelves are being used for
          items you access the most often." Look for Storage Spaces Elsewhere.
          If you use that huge roasting pan only during the holidays, look for
          another storage space in the garage, attic, basement, or a
          miscellaneous closet. Other seasonal items, like holiday-themed cookie
          cutters, can be stored with holiday decorations. And seasonal outdoor
          cooking equipment can be stored with camping gear, or any other
          warm-weather supplies you're likely to pull out at the same time. <br /> Add
          Organizing Tools. Most kitchens only offer the bare bones of what we
          need to stay organized, so a few strategic products here and there can
          be helpful to customize the space to your needs. "Kitchen cabinets
          don’t typically need a lot of products, but drawers can benefit from
          organizers to give boundaries to your categories and prevent them from
          shifting," Murphy says. Make use of vertical space, as well. You may
          be able to add shallow racks or hooks to the inside of cabinet and
          pantry doors to take advantage of every inch of space. Or, add a wall
          or ceiling-mounted pot rack to clear up some space inside cabinets.
          Don't forget the space between the upper cabinets or shelves and the
          countertop. It's a perfect space for hanging paper towels or adding
          magnetic strips for knives and other utensils.
