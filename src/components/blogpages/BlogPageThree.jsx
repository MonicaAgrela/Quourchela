          Extra virgin olive oil is the main pillar of the Mediterranean diet
          and we should take care of it the way it deserves. Such a valuable
          product is worth our attention both when conserving it and when using
          it for cooking. Today I’ll share a few tips to make your oil last
          longer in optimal condition and to allow you to make the most of all
          its flavor. You probably use extra virgin olive oil on a daily basis,
          just like me. Over the years I have learned to take care of little
          details that are often neglected in day-to-day use. Reading and
          listening to advice–anything is welcome when it comes to taking care
          of our liquid gold so as not to make any mistakes when using,
          consuming and conserving it.

          cooking salmon like lime, salt, pepper, rosemary and olive oil are

          and Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM The first mistake is crystal
          clear: cooking with anything other than extra virgin olive oil. The
          notion that extra virgin oil, being of higher quality, should only be
          consumed uncooked is widespread. But EVOO is perfect for cooking for a
          number of reasons. For instance, it boosts the flavor of foods and
          makes them conserve their properties much better–and that in itself is
          a health benefit. HOW TO COOK WITH OLIVE OIL When cooking with olive
          oil there are a number of very common mistakes that we often make. One
          of them is pouring some oil on a cold frying pan when we are going to
          prepare something grilled. Here we’ll see that the oil starts smoking,
          meaning that it’s burning, and you surely won’t get the benefits you
          could from it. What’s the solution? Very simple: pour the oil on when
          the frying pan is already hot or pour it on the food we are about to
          put in the pan.
