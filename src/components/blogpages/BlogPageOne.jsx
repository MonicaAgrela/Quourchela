        <h4>1. Read the Recipe—Then Read It Again</h4>
        <p>
          If you've been cooking for a while, you know the feeling. You're
          moving and grooving through Step 3 of your breakfast casserole recipe
          when you realize it has to chill in the fridge overnight. Oops. It
          happens to the best of us, which is why our advice is to read the
          entire recipe. Once you've done that, read it again, from start to
          finish. That way, you know exactly how long the recipe will take you,
          what tools you'll be using, how many ingredients there are, and how
          much of each ingredient you will need, which brings us to our next
          piece of cooking advice.

        <h2>2. Practice Mise En Place</h2>
        <p>
          Once you've thoroughly read the recipe and well before you preheat the
          oven or start boiling water, it's time for a little mise en place
          practice. A French term that means "put in place," mise en place is
          the strategy chefs (and now, you) use to stay organized and move
          through a recipe without any hiccups. This involves prepping all your
          ingredients beforehand. Chop those veggies, measure out that sugar,
          and grab each tool you'll use prior to cooking. That way, not only
          will your cooking process go smoothly, but you'll realize if you're a
          cup of sugar shy before you're halfway through the recipe and can't go
          to the store. (Psst…This also makes cooking tip Number 4 easier.){" "}

        <h4>1. Read the Recipe—Then Read It Again</h4>
        3.Taste and Season as You Go You can always add more salt, but you can't
        take it out of a dish. Some cooks follow the philosophy that there's no
        such thing as over-seasoning, but you're better safe than salty. Rather
        than seasoning at the beginning and end of a recipe, season and taste
        throughout the cooking process. That way, you know your flavors are in
        the right direction and your final product will be perfectly balanced.
        4. And Clean as You Go There's an old saying about not going to bed
        angry, but as one of our wise readers told us, it's just as important to
        "never go to bed with a dirty kitchen." The worst part about cooking is
        the messy kitchen afterward. To prevent staying up all night to clean up
        after your masterpiece, clean as you cook. <br /> As soon as you're
        finished using a dish, knife, or kitchen tool, go ahead and wash it or
        throw it in the dishwasher. That way, after you enjoy your dinner, all
        you have to do is put up the dishes you ate off of, wipe the counters
        down, and relax. 5. Buy a Few High-Quality Kitchen Tools and Take Care
        of Them If you want to become a great cook, you don't need a
        restaurant-worthy kitchen and expensive tools. Find a set of nonstick
        cookware you love, a trusty sheet pan, a cast-iron skillet, and a
        good-quality chef's knife, and you're off to the races. Be sure to keep
        your knives sharp and take care of your cast iron. As you learn to cook,
        you'll find fun kitchen tools to add to your collection, but there's
        nothing wrong with keeping it simple. 6. Practice, Practice, Practice
        Julia Child said to "be fearless" in the kitchen, and with fearlessness
        inevitably comes mistakes. Guess what? That's just fine! As with any new
        hobby, there's a learning curve with cooking, and you're going to mess
        up from time to time. Even the best chefs have soufflés that don't rise,
        casseroles that won't set, and biscuits that burn. <br /> Don't be
        afraid to try new recipes just because something might go wrong. If
        you've never baked bread from scratch, try it! Want to recreate a dish
        from your favorite Indian restaurant? More power to you! Cooking is
        creative, innovative, and fun, so don't forget to keep it that way as
        you go. You learn by doing, not watching. Regardless whether you take
        this cooking advice or not, there's one important tip we have to leave
        you with: Whatever comes out of your kitchen, cook (or bake, fry, sauté,
        toss…you get the picture) with love. Food is the great connector, the
        one language every human on earth understands. Cook with and for your
        family and friends. Make memories together. Have fun. Learn something
        new.
