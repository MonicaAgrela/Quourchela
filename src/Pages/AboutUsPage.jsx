    <h2>About us...</h2>
    <p>Quourchela is a food app where the name is born from the fusion of the two last names of the founders: 
    "Quourchi" and "Agrela".
    The purpose of our page is to have an app where you can find several recipes that are concentrated by their type and not by the country they are from.</p>
    We offer our users the chance to add new recipes, edit and delete the you they want.
    We also have our Blog where you can share curiosities or other things about food so that other users can see and use.
